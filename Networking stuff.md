PiBots etc need to be controllable over WiFi.

The idea here is to have a simple network setup that allows a user to SSH and/or VNC into their PiBot headlessly.

Two main things need to happen:

1. The Pi needs to boot and join a known WiFi SSID without any prompting from the User

2. The User needs to be aware (somehow) of the IP address or hostname of the Pi
